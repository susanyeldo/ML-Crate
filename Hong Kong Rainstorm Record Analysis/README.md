# Project Title

Hong Kong Rainstorm Record Analysis

# Aim 

This dataset contains the record of every rainstorm warning signal posted from April 1998 to August 2022 in Hong Kong. 
Information about the rainfall patterns has also been mentioned, i.e, warning signal colour, start date, end date, start time, end time and duration.

# Dataset 

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/henrychan1862/hong-kong-rainstorm-record-apr1998aug2022

# Approach

Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visulaization is performed on the dataset. 
The data is plotted onto bar graphs and pie charts to see warning sign colours alongside the duration and date of rainfall.

# Steps Involved 

All the necessary libraries are imported
Reading the dataset
Data Visualization to visualize the data and get meaningful insights:
  * Pie chart which shows the relative frquency of appearance of each warning sign colour.
  * Bar Graph that shows the distribution of rainfall throughout the months. 
  * Bar Graph that shows the distribution of duration of rainfall.
  * Line Graph that shows total duration of rainfall throughout the years.
  * Line Graph that shows the linear regression of total duration of rainfall.

# Visualizaton

## Language Used - Python

## Libraries Used - pandas, seaborn, matplotlib

# Conclusion

* As Amber signal dominates, we conclude that a rainfall of less than 30mm/hr occurs most of the time.
* We observe that the maximum rainfall occurs in June. We can classify the period from May-August as Monsoon.
* On an average rainfall lasted 1-2 hours each occurance.
* There is a net positive increase in total duration of rainfall after the year 2012.

The dataset was analysed and the above analysis were made , which can be used by people to see data about rainfall records in a visually appealing way.
